    <h3 class="story-h3">Wyatt</h3>
    <strong><p>Born in:</strong> Boston, Massachussetts<br><br>
<strong>Hobby:</strong> Wyatt is a big time "shutterbug" and some form of camera always travels with him, so he can be ready to capture any moment in life. He enjoys traveling and plans to spend a lifetime traveling with Olivia. <br> <br>
<strong>Favorite sport:</strong> Hockey<br><br>
<strong>Favorite food: </strong> Wyatt loves anything that is put in front of him. He raves about how great his mom and sisters cook so Olivia sure does have a high bar set for her. His favorite dish is Chicken Parmesan or Lasagna.<br><br>
<strong>If Olivia could choose for Wyatt to be a superhero:</strong> Olivia would without a doubt wish for him to be THOR, not just based off of the character alone but because of Chris Hemsworth. (She's loves Marvel). <br><br> </p>

   <p><h3 class="story-h3"> How We Met</h3><br><br>
   <br>
   Our story begins in March 2008 at LaGuardia Airport 
in New York. Both Wyatt and I were flying to Peru to study abroad with a group 
of ten other classmates. After a mutual friend introduced us we realized our 
seats were very close to each other. Wyatt could tell that I, a classic nervous 
flyer, could use some   support so he came over to ease my nerves. A pretty 
turbulent flight allowed us to get to know each other. Throughout the rest of
the study abroad semester we became good friends. As summer approached, we 
learned that we would be interning across the street from each other in New 
York. After having lunch together every day that summer we both knew it was 
only a matter of time. When we got back to school for fall semester the rest was 
history! <br>     ---Olivia

    <h3 class="story-h3">Olivia</h3>
          <p><strong>Born in: </strong> Albany, New York<br><br>
<strong>Hobby: </strong> You would never find Olivia sitting still even through shopping, she would be dancing through the aisles. She carries her own mix of music in her head and can jam out at anytime.<br><br>
<strong>Favorite sport: </strong>Annoying Wyatt and Volleyball.<br><br>

<strong>Favorite Food:</strong> Olivia is a foodie! Her favorite food is Italian and Thai but she can sure clean her plate with anything Wyatt puts in front of her.<br><br>
<strong>
If Wyatt could choose Olivia to be a superhero: </strong> He would wish for her to be Catwoman not because of the horrible movie with Halle Berry, it's so he can have sporadic hand to hand combat with her as Thor!<br><br>

        <h3 class="story-h3">The Proposal</h3>
          <p>Wyatt wanted his proposal to be an unforgettable moment for Olivia. So he enlisted the help of Madison, one of Olivia's best friends. Leading up to her birthday, Wyatt told Olivia that they were going to take a trip to the Catskills for vacation during the summer of 2016. Olivia was very excited and even bought a cute traveling suitcase to put her clothes in. Despite her knowing about a vacation trip, Wyatt surprised Olivia and booked tickets to Los Angeles instead thans to Madison helping Wyatt plan. They spent their day exploring parts of the California Wild Adventure Park. On the second day, the happy couple celebrated Olivia's birthday in Disneyland. That same night moments before the evening fireworks took place, Wyatt got down on one knee in front of the Disney Castle and there proposed! In the happiest place on earth, she made him the happiest man on Earth. With the biggest smile on her face, she uttered the three-lettered word that Wyatt had been anxiously waiting to hear.. "YES!". </p>

    <h4 class="story-h4">Madison Farmer<br>Maid of Honor</h4>
          <p>Ohhhh Madison. It was truly love at first tutoring session. She actually went to high school with Wyatt but turned out to be one of my best and earliest friends I made in college. We just get each other, and there is never a boring time between us and the best part is she's always been there for me and Wyatt. My best memory of Madison now probably has to be her being there every step of the way as Wyatt proposed, even though I had no clue she was helping him plan the whole thing!!<br><br><strong>---Olivia </strong></p></div>

    <h4 class="story-h4">Casey McBride<br>Bridesmaid</h4>
          <p>Oh where to start...I've never met anyone as chic, caring, or funny as Casey McBride. Behind her hilarious post cards, weekly phone calls and hot pink pants, she's one of the best people and friends I've ever met. I knew we'd be great friends ever since Greene dorm days in college. One of my best memories of Casey is late nights looking for friends rooms to eat in the dorms.

    <h4 class="story-h4">Jacob Donahue<br>Best Man</h4>
          <p>Jacob is my Best Man, 2rd oldest brother and one of my best friends.  No matter how many rounds of golf we play, music will always be blaring and beers will be cracked open.  Stallone, his alter ego, will come out at the wedding, but hopefully just at the reception.<br><br><strong>---Wyatt </strong></p>

          <h4 class="story-h4">Alexander Daniels<br>Groomsman</h4>
          <p>Alex is one of my pledge brothers and college best friends.  We were roommates on 54th street in Manhattan for most of our late 20's and created so many memories that will not be forgotten. We made our way through college and I'm incredibly happy to have him as my groomsman. His favorite past time is bocce ball, which he claims he is the king. I beg to differ!<br><br><strong>---Wyatt </strong></p>
